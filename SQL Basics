# 📝 Order of Writing SQL Commands (Syntax Order)

## 📖 Definition:
The order of writing SQL commands refers to the **syntax structure** you follow when writing SQL queries. It tells SQL how to understand your request.

Even if SQL **executes** commands in a different order internally, you must **write** them in the proper order to avoid errors.

## 🧱 Syntax Structure (Write in this order):

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column [ASC|DESC]
LIMIT number;
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
WHERE status = 'Active'
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
ORDER BY employee_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
 In this example:

SELECT: Chooses department & total employees

FROM: The table used is employees

WHERE: Filters only active employees

GROUP BY: Groups data by department

HAVING: Filters departments with more than 10 employees

ORDER BY: Sorts result from highest to lowest count

LIMIT: Shows only top 5 departments
